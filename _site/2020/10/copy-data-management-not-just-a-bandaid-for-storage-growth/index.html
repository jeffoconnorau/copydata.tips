While storage companies in the plenty have added many significant features like zero byte clones, snapshots, and dedup these orgs are still consuming storage at a rapid rate. Companies selling dedup arrays, actually want you to buy more arrays… 10yrs ago when Actifio was formed, we started as we realised that most of the addressable storage was not in Production, it was in the supporting layers hidden behind the scenes, the dev/test/pre-prod, the backup and DR copies, all consuming yet another copy of your stuff, because it is needed for that use case. I really feel for these orgs that have yet to hit the stop button on their storage spend. But for those that have, they are consolidating, and or introducing cloud to assist, and I can guarantee you, this is not a cloud fixable issue, if you have storage sprawl on-premises, you are going to have storage sprawl in the cloud. It’s the mindset and process that needs to factor in other ways to solve these problems. Cloud storage might seem cheap, but when you introduce your existing process, that storage consumption will just expand as it always has. So, my advice is… Take a look under the covers at your storage consumption, for Production, versus non-Production. The non-production number might really surprise you, and it’s also very likely where most of the growth is spent. If you are interested in cost avoidance for existing storage for the new few years You want access to data for Non-Production near instantly You want to leverage the cloud, but with cost considerations in place.
