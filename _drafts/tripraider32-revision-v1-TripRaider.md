Working for a Start-Up, we try to save money where we can, and spend it where it will most make sense.

As part of this effort across my team, we often need to travel at the last minute to visit with a customer. Sometimes we can plan ahead of time to get good hotel and flight discounts, and other’s we are just unfortunate. So we often will use Wotif or LastMinute.Com to get their secret last minute hotel deals.

So I came across this website, that shows you the last minute description of a hotel, and uncovers the real name of the hotel for you. This is especially helpful when you want to ensure you stay close to a customer office, or want to stay at a particular hotel.

The site is called: [TripRaider](http://www.tripraider.com/ "TripRaider")

And my last helpful tip: I tried to register for the site to add a hotel I stayed at recently in Canberra. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A brand new hotel there is called “Hotel Hotel” the secret text for that one is “5\* luxury wonder in the heart of Canberra!” This is a brand new hotel in the recently built Nishi building in Canberra.</span>

I recommend the hotel, it’s a funky new style of hotel, and for the last minute price, was money well spent considering some of the hotels I have stayed at in Canberra in my time charging a lot more !
