Long time since I last posted, and while a lot has changed, a lot of things are still the same…

Anyway, this is quick post to reference that I am in San Francisco right now, and excited to attend VMware Explore 2022. I am also presenting on Tuesday at 1.30pm in the Moscone South – Expo Theater #2. My session is called “Simplify Storage and Data Protection For Google Cloud VMware Engine \[CEIB3024USS\]”.

I will be talking about Google Cloud VMware Engine &amp; the Google Cloud Backup and DR product and capability. Where I will go into some of the capabilities of the product, and also some of the architecture principles and benefits for the product. It’s a pretty neat solution for VMware workloads, but also Enterprise Databases, and Filesystems too. I look forward to seeing you there, if you are around.

In addition to my session, I will be spending time on the Expo floor @ the Google Cloud booth, and generally network amongst the vExpert peers, and catching up with old friends and colleagues.

My last time in person at VMworld was in 2011 at Las Vegas, and my session on EUC/VDI there was a blast. So some good memories there for sure.

Happy to be back, and already walking around the streets of SF today, I can feel like this weeks conference is going to be good on many levels. Feel free to say hi if you are around.

Cheers
