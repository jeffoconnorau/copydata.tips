Schedule the backups from 6-2am, and replication from 3am-7am. While this seems like common sense, itâ€™s not often done.

Attached are some images for an SLA policy that achieves this, and also an XML file you can import, so you too have this SLA Template imported and ready to go. Just modify your retention times and off you go !
