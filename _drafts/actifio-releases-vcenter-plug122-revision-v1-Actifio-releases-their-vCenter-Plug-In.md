This release was an often requested feature for a number of my customers, so I am really pleased that itâ€™s here.

I was involved with some early beta testing, and I must say I was impressed with the level of functionality we added to the plug-in for a 1.0 release.

It really should reduce the VMware Administrators need to login to the Actifio Desktop for day to day administration. Apart from SLA creation or modification, you should be good to go with this plug-in.

Existing customers can request access to this downlaod via their Sales Team or grab it from the Web Portal.

I hope you make some good use of it. Please get in touch if you would like to see some more features added in the coming releases. Here are some screen shots of my favourite features.
