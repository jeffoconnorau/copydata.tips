Hi,

This will only be a brief intro to this blog. Essentially this blog will be primarily about the world of “Copy Data” and optimising your environment and infrastructure for “Copy Data”.

Some of the posts will come from lessons learned, or lessons taught with articles on everything to do with managing a Copy Data platform and integrating it into your enterprise. While the Actifio 100T CDS appliance and associated products is my primary focus, this product integrates with many different systems such as: VMware, Hyper V, Linux, Unix, SQL, Exchange, Scripting, Powershell, All types of Storage, Disaster Recovery products, Blade and server infrastructure, Security devices such as Firewalls, Routers, etc. The list is almost endless on what might be covered here in the weeks and months to come.

Please send your feedback and comments. The usual disclaimer is applied, while I work for a vendor I will try to be as impartial as I can towards all products, and the articles and topics here are written by me, and can no way be referenced as an official Actifio support article or legal document.

Thanks for the motivation
