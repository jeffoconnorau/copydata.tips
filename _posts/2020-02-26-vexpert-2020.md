Just a quick note to say, thank you and I am humbled to receive an vExpert award for 2020.

While I have been lucky to receive this award for the last few years, it’s always a nice surprise to get it. Of the many benefits to this program, one of the key things I appreciate is the vExpert Slack chat, for discussing tech with other vExperts across the globe. The real time access to guru’s catering for just about every piece of infrastructure I encounter in the wild is great. You can ask a quick question, or receive some immediate guidance that in many cases, can help you or your customer avoid an issue. The benefits are hard to ignore, and for the access to those people I am grateful.

Hope to see you all at a Sydney VMUG soon !

Cheers,

Jeff
