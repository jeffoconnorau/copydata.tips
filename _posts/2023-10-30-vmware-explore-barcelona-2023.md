This is quick post to reference that I am heading to Barcelona next week, and I am excited to attend VMware Explore Barcelona 2023.

If you are in Barcelona for VMware Explore and want to discuss Disaster Recovery - \[CEIM2415BCNS\], then come check out this roundtable session my good friend Ibrahima N'Doye and I will be hosting. We'd love to see you there !

The focus of our session is about DR to the cloud. We will focus on Google Cloud Backup and DR for On-premises workloads, along with how to orchestrate DR, and what dependencies you need to consider to make it successful.

This is my first visit to the city of Barcelona, and I can't wait to meet many of our current and future Google Cloud customers at the event. I will also be at the Google Cloud Booth every day, so please come past and say hello if you are attending.

Please click the link below to add this session to your content catalogue, and or stop by the booth to say Hello !
