#### [vExpert 2016 Award Announcement](http://bit.ly/1Ppq7Yg)

First we would like to say thank you to everyone who applied for the 2016 vExpert program. Iâ€™m pleased to announce the list 2016 vExperts. Each of these vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others. Contributing is not always blogging or Twitter as there are many public speakers, book authors, script writers, VMUG leaders, VMTN community moderators and internal champions among this group.
